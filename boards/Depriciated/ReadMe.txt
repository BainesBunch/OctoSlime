The resistor is a 180k ohm through hole resistor, this resistor is to make it possible to monitor internal batteries charge level


The 2 rectifier diodes are Schottky 1N5817 and when correctly wired to the battery management TP4056 module allows for you to safely charge and use Octo-Slime at the same time, ultimately allowing you to extend the run-time of the Rig through a power pack in addition to or instead of an internal one built into the Rig
